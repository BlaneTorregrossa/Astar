#preconditions: node objects must have g f h and parent variables
#node objects must access position elements through node[0] "posx" or node[1] "posy"
#so if you have a node.positionx it will be node[0]
#so if you have a node.positiony it will be node[1]
#to calculate neighbors replace your fetch for adjacents/neighbors with
#getneighbors(current, graph)
#this returns a list of nodes
#parameters: start, goal, graph
#postconditions: function will return a list
